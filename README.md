<p align="center">One-click, secure, and portable document verification system using image steganography.</p>

---

## 🚀 Overview

**ValiDoc** eliminates the hassle of verifying digital documents. Using smart steganography, it embeds verification data directly into image files. The result? A self-contained, portable, and tamper-evident document that can be authenticated anywhere — with just one click.

## 🧠 Why ValiDoc?

Imagine receiving a digital certificate, ID, or report. How do you know it’s real?  
**ValiDoc** gives you:

✔️ Instant authentication  
✔️ No need for external servers during verification  
✔️ End-to-end security with embedded document data  

We use **image steganography** to hide verification info within random RGB pixels of the image — invisible to the human eye, but verifiable by our system.
